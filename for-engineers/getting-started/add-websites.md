# Add websites

Websites in Web3 usually have two different possible configurations :&#x20;

* The "Connect wallet" button is directly on the website "homepage"&#x20;
* The "Connect wallet" button is placed on an "app" page different from the homepage

Regardless of your website configuration, you will need to enter the domain name of your homepage. If your website also contains an "app" page including a "connect wallet" button, you will also need to mention it.&#x20;

Please, remove `https` and `www` from the URL, keep the `hostname` (yourdomain.com).

For example, if your site is `https://www.yourdomain.com` then enter in the "**Domain**" field is `yourdomain.com`. Same for `app.yourdomain.com.`&#x20;
