You will be able to invite other members to your project from your dashboard.&#x20;

## Join a project&#x20;

If one of your team members already created a project and invited you to join, you should have received an email invitation from **"hello@safary.club".** Click on the "Set Up account" button in the email to join the project.&#x20;

If you didn't receive the email, take a look at your "spam" or "notifications" inbox.
